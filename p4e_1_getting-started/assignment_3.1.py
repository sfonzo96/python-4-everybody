# Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.
# Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
# Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
# You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
# Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.

#hour = input("Enter Hours:")
#rate = input("Enter Rate:")

##payment = 0

# try:
#     hs = float(hour)
#     rt = float(rate)
#     if hs > 40:
#        payment = 40 * rt + (hs - 40) * rt * 1.5
#     else:
#         payment = hs * rt
# except:
#     print("Error, please enter numeric input")
#     quit()
